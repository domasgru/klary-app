1. Where you are best at:
 - I think you deliver highest quality UI, I don't see any difference from UI side from your apps and other top-apps. 
Actually I think yours is even BETTER. I think you really have sense for that and are really talented.
You also show a lot of potential in UX, for example I love current auth flow and what we are discussing about other screens.
Also I love flow we did in logomaker.

- You really strive for the best. I see you coming back to old screens and pollishing them. Also you often underestimate time you
will take for screen, but I think thats just because you try to make it perfect.

- I think you are so curious. You know so much things about various applications. I think that you really love what you do
because I couldn't imagine you knowing so much things, apps and etc. without a passion.

- You will always tell what you think in a first second. For example if you dont like something I suggest, you will always say us and
prevent mistakes.

- You are so open minded. You are always intrested what other thinks.

2. Where you could improve:
- Time estimation. Acutally I even like that you often overestimate things, because I see the reason behind that. Anyway
having in mind that you will probably want to pollish things up and it may take some more time than you think would be not worse 
imo.

- I think you should be more confident. Also i absolutely agree that we should look whats already done by smart people. But I just think you really could slightly
become more confident to experiment and take some innovations. Like not absolutely but a little bit more than you do now. Now sometimes I it looks that you
want to do something just because you seen it somewhere but without really clear arguments. Anyway I'm not 100% sure on that, this is just a little tought.
